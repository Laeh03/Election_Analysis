# Election-Audit Results

The first findings was to look into cities and not just counties. We can go into depth by looking at which cities held a significant position in determining if a candidate will win the election. Obviously, we would have to gather this data and input it into our election_results.csv file then do the same concept as we did for our counties. The second findings, we could continue and modify this script for future use if we can see the demographics among the different candidates. Age, sex, and ethnicity are three that are significant and in the interest of the candidates to understand which group they need to appeal to more. As stated before, we need to add these inputs into the election_results.csv file in order to begin the script for it. These two examples can be used for future puposes for candidates to see how to win a future election.
These were the findings of the following tasks in the election audit:
